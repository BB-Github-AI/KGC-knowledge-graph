This talk will review knowledge graphs in the supply chain and look into the details of implementation. In our central case, using a semantic model, we build a ‘digital twin’ of a complex inventory management supply chain. Data from heterogeneous sources - including warehouse management systems, point of sale systems and weather data – are then imported into the knowledge graph. Using the graph we carry out analytics, optimization, scheduling and Monte Carlo simulations. A complex set of operations built around the central supply chain knowledge graph. The net result is a predictive analytic system that delivers real value to the enterprise (up to a 50% reduction in inventory). The knowledge graph can be extended to include product information and other central commercial data use cases.

Examples of areas we investigated for the integration of linked data include: knowledge panels bringing in contextual information and relationships from knowledge graphs like Wikidata to describe people and subjects related to library resources in the catalog; suggested searches based on user-entered queries using results from Wikidata and DbPedia; and browsing experiences for subjects and authors bringing in relationships and data from Wikidata and library authorities.  In this presentation, we will review the challenges and opportunities with bringing in information from external knowledge graphs into a library catalog to support discovery.

However, speech recognition technology for domain specific industries with lots of product names, industry lingo, and acronyms often creates a challenge for accuracy and usefulness of the content.

These data constitute a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs of today enable data reuse and federation thus improving information retrieval and facilitating research and knowledge discovery in various fields, they do not store information about claims and related online discourse data, making it difficult to access, query and reuse this wealth of information. In my talk, I will present recent work in collaboration with the Leibniz Institute of Social Sciences GESIS (Germany), on the construction of ClaimsKG - a knowledge graph of fact-checked controversial claims, which facilitates structured queries about their truth values, authors, dates, journalistic reviews and other kinds of metadata and provides ground truth data for a number of tasks relevant to the analysis of societal debates on the web. I will discuss perspectives on modelling claims in a generalized and contextualized manner, as well as related challenges such as claim disambiguation and the assessment of claim relatedness. I will present preliminary results on learning claim vector representations (embeddings) from ClaimsKG and their application for the task of automatic fact-checking." ;

In doing so over the past 4 years, we also helped other departments across the firm discover and embrace semantic data modeling for their own use cases. In the first part of our presentation, we would like to briefly describe the Semantic Modeling and Ontology consortium we created within the Firm before diving deeper into our knowledge base creation effort. We think that a knowledge base reflecting concepts specifically relevant to our company is extremely valuable to develop semantic technology applications. However, populating knowledge bases can be time consuming, costly and error prone, with an end product that is difficult to maintain. In the second part of this presentation, we would like to discuss a framework for automatic generation of a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) knowledge base from unstructured text. Our Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine parses the input text to create a semantic knowledge graph, which is then mapped to a SKOS knowledge model. During the linguistic understanding of the text, relevant domain concepts are identified and connected by semantic links -- abstractions of underlying relations between concepts that capture the overall meaning of text based on a corpus of roughly 6,500 policies and procedures published at Morgan Stanley." ;

Once built, the graph can serve as the source of data for many applications, including Machine and Deep Learning use cases.

In this talk, we present the engineering of an ontology--the Pinterest Taxonomy--that forms the core of Pinterest's knowledge graph, the Pinterest Taste Graph. We describe modeling choices and enhancements to the cloud-based WebProtégé tool that we used for the creation of the ontology. In two months, eight Pinterest engineers, without prior experience of ontologies, knowledge graphs, and WebProtégé, revamped an existing taxonomy of noisy terms into an OWL ontology, which they then combine with additional structured information and machinery to form the Pinterest Taste Graph. We share our experience and present the key aspects of our work that we believe will be useful for others working in this area." ;

The graph incorporates hundreds of millions of entities such as properties, addresses, individual and commercial owners, lenders, brokers, estate managers, lawyers etc. as nodes – while the edges are various types of connections between the entities. A wealth of attributes are associated with each entity. Cherre’s knowledge graph is a closed-world graph: it allows inferring an absence of connection between two entities if there is no edge between them in the graph. Furthermore, Cherre’s graph is temporal: edges and nodes are being added and deleted on a timely basis. Some of the main challenges in constructing a closed-world graph from noisy data sources are entity resolution and disambiguation. In this talk, we will present parallel algorithms for entity resolution and disambiguation in Cherre’s knowledge graph, and outline our current work on assessing entity similarities using (temporal) node embedding." ;

From classifying entity type of source entities, to reconcile entities across sources (e.g. Brad Pitt from Wikipedia vs. Brad Pitt from IMDB), and blending conflicting and complementing facts for each entity from different sources, the YK graph encapsulates production scale machine learning solutions for multi-label classification(e.g. predicted entity types for Arnold Schwarzenegger could be Actor, Politician, BusinessPerson etc ), large scale high precision binary classifiers along with an array of distributed hashing techniques help scale a potential billion edge comparisons (de-duplication of entities across sources require high precision classifiers for which we develop active learning and precision clamped training strategies) and lastly hubs and authorities based fact blending from competing sources. To support product initiatives like surfacing knowledge augmented results on web and sponsored searches we build a variety of \"knowledge discovery\" services like 1. knowledge triples based question answering and reading comprehension type question answering utilizing our blended/merged knowledge graph, 2. related entities for a given entity to other connected entities beyond direct ontological relations to generate browsing interest to other sites/properties in Yahoo. In contrast to broad cross domain knowledge, we delve into deep domain specific information extraction from news text and videos to power unique experiences for brands like Yahoo! Sports. Specifically for US Sports (NBA/NFL/NHL/MLB/Soccer) our text information extraction sits in the cross roads of fact finding in articles, fine grained entity typing and topical extractive summarization of temporal topics like trades/contracts/injuries and performances connecting player and potential teams to provide 360 degree browsing of daily fantasy news/sports rumors. Through our Video deep linking capabilities we link moments in highlight videos to points in time of a game such that we can power within-video search/browse experiences for e.g. queries like \"Lebron Jame's dunks from yesterday\" would seek to exact moments in a highlight video where LeBron dunked or \"Laker's top scorer's tonight\" would find the stats of the top Laker's scorers, followed by seeking to exact moments of their plays in highlight videos." ;

    schema:abstract """The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) has matured in significant areas over the last few years, but until recently there were few examples to help users understand how to interpret it and build it into their own knowledge graphs. Since early 2019, the FIBO development team has been focused primarily on use cases to address the steep learning curve: 
• How to represent businesses and incorporate data about them that is publicly available, such as identifiers, locations, ownership and control information and other details from the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), Open Corporates, state and government registries, etc.,
• How to use that information to investigate counterparty relationships,
• How to build on that baseline to represent securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) issued by these organizations,
• How to leverage those securities to represent the components of an index and track index performance, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average,
• How to use this information to represent more complex derivative instruments.
In this talk, we will take a quick cook’s tour through some of the more basic use cases and related ontologies. The approach that FIBO has taken to build a use case stack that can be used to demonstrate the value of knowledge graphs translates well to most domain-specific projects. The use cases, ontologies, and reference and example data are all publicly available and open source. While some of the work is still underway, the basic building blocks are in place. Conference participants can download and try them, and the cook’s tour is intended to provide enough of an introduction to help make that feasible.""" ;

A detailed use case for this application which is an issue tracking system for Oil & Gas companies is presented in this work. In the introduced use case, the interlinks between failure events and their associated actions are captured in a knowledge graph. To overcome data sparsity, scarcity, and non-trivial relationships, a relatively new concept called ‘meta-graphs’ are employed. Using meta-graph patterns defined on the knowledge graph schema, we can recommend actions based on the semantic relatedness of the various failure events and their corrective actions. Moreover, the recommendation results selected by the end-user and the meta-graphs evaluated by the domain experts are automatically graded during the entire lifecycle of the system for transfer learning, reliability evaluation and reproducibility." ;
