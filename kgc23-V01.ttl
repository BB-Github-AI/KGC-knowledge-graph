This talk will review knowledge graphs in the supply chain and look into the details of implementation. In our central case, using a semantic model, we build a ‘digital twin’ of a complex inventory management supply chain. Data from heterogeneous sources - including warehouse management systems, point of sale systems and weather data – are then imported into the knowledge graph. Using the graph we carry out analytics, optimization, scheduling and Monte Carlo simulations. A complex set of operations built around the central supply chain knowledge graph. The net result is a predictive analytic system that delivers real value to the enterprise (up to a 50% reduction in inventory). The knowledge graph can be extended to include product information and other central commercial data use cases.

Examples of areas we investigated for the integration of linked data include: knowledge panels bringing in contextual information and relationships from knowledge graphs like Wikidata to describe people and subjects related to library resources in the catalog; suggested searches based on user-entered queries using results from Wikidata and DbPedia; and browsing experiences for subjects and authors bringing in relationships and data from Wikidata and library authorities.

These data constitute a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. While knowledge graphs of today enable data reuse and federation thus improving information retrieval and facilitating research and knowledge discovery in various fields, they do not store information about claims and related online discourse data, making it difficult to access, query and reuse this wealth of information. In my talk, I will present recent work in collaboration with the Leibniz Institute of Social Sciences GESIS (Germany), on the construction of ClaimsKG - a knowledge graph of fact-checked controversial claims, which facilitates structured queries about their truth values, authors, dates, journalistic reviews and other kinds of metadata and provides ground truth data for a number of tasks relevant to the analysis of societal debates on the web. I will discuss perspectives on modelling claims in a generalized and contextualized manner, as well as related challenges such as claim disambiguation and the assessment of claim relatedness.

In doing so over the past 4 years, we also helped other departments across the firm discover and embrace semantic data modeling for their own use cases. In the first part of our presentation, we would like to briefly describe the Semantic Modeling and Ontology consortium we created within the Firm before diving deeper into our knowledge base creation effort. We think that a knowledge base reflecting concepts specifically relevant to our company is extremely valuable to develop semantic technology applications. However, populating knowledge bases can be time consuming, costly and error prone, with an end product that is difficult to maintain. In the second part of this presentation, we would like to discuss a framework for automatic generation of a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) knowledge base from unstructured text. Our Natural Language Processing (NLP) engine parses the input text to create a semantic knowledge graph, which is then mapped to a SKOS knowledge model. During the linguistic understanding of the text, relevant domain concepts are identified and connected by semantic links -- abstractions of underlying relations between concepts that capture the overall meaning of text based on a corpus of roughly 6,500 policies and procedures published at Morgan Stanley." ;

Because building a knowledge graph means you are consolidating your important knowledge assets, and that forces you to think of the “bigger picture” of all the data you have in your organization including shared, common domain models. You are not merely shoving data into a warehouse, but actually thinking how different things connect and fit together. Once built, the graph can serve as the source of data for many applications, including Machine and Deep Learning use cases. In this talk, we will walk through the typical tasks involved in building a knowledge graph, options for data modeling and querying (e.g., RDF and Property Graph), as well as tools and integrations.

In the last year, the company decided to create a knowledge graph that aims to represent the vast amount of content and users on Pinterest, to help both content recommendation and ads targeting. In this talk, we present the engineering of an ontology--the Pinterest Taxonomy--that forms the core of Pinterest's knowledge graph, the Pinterest Taste Graph. We describe modeling choices and enhancements to the cloud-based WebProtégé tool that we used for the creation of the ontology. In two months, eight Pinterest engineers, without prior experience of ontologies, knowledge graphs, and WebProtégé, revamped an existing taxonomy of noisy terms into an OWL ontology, which they then combine with additional structured information and machinery to form the Pinterest Taste Graph. We share our experience and present the key aspects of our work that we believe will be useful for others working in this area." ;

The graph incorporates hundreds of millions of entities such as properties, addresses, individual and commercial owners, lenders, brokers, estate managers, lawyers etc. as nodes – while the edges are various types of connections between the entities. A wealth of attributes are associated with each entity. Cherre’s knowledge graph is a closed-world graph: it allows inferring an absence of connection between two entities if there is no edge between them in the graph. Furthermore, Cherre’s graph is temporal: edges and nodes are being added and deleted on a timely basis. Some of the main challenges in constructing a closed-world graph from noisy data sources are entity resolution and disambiguation. In this talk, we will present parallel algorithms for entity resolution and disambiguation in Cherre’s knowledge graph, and outline our current work on assessing entity similarities using (temporal) node embedding." ;

From classifying entity type of source entities, to reconcile entities across sources (e.g. Brad Pitt from Wikipedia vs. Brad Pitt from IMDB), and blending conflicting and complementing facts for each entity from different sources, the YK graph encapsulates production scale machine learning solutions for multi-label classification(e.g. predicted entity types for Arnold Schwarzenegger could be Actor, Politician, BusinessPerson etc ), large scale high precision binary classifiers along with an array of distributed hashing techniques help scale a potential billion edge comparisons (de-duplication of entities across sources require high precision classifiers for which we develop active learning and precision clamped training strategies) and lastly hubs and authorities based fact blending from competing sources. To support product initiatives like surfacing knowledge augmented results on web and sponsored searches we build a variety of \"knowledge discovery\" services like 1. knowledge triples based question answering and reading comprehension type question answering utilizing our blended/merged knowledge graph, 2. related entities for a given entity to other connected entities beyond direct ontological relations to generate browsing interest to other sites/properties in Yahoo. In contrast to broad cross domain knowledge, we delve into deep domain specific information extraction from news text and videos to power unique experiences for brands like Yahoo! Sports. Specifically for US Sports (NBA/NFL/NHL/MLB/Soccer) our text information extraction sits in the cross roads of fact finding in articles, fine grained entity typing and topical extractive summarization of temporal topics like trades/contracts/injuries and performances connecting player and potential teams to provide 360 degree browsing of daily fantasy news/sports rumors. Through our Video deep linking capabilities we link moments in highlight videos to points in time of a game such that we can power within-video search/browse experiences for e.g. queries like \"Lebron Jame's dunks from yesterday\" would seek to exact moments in a highlight video where LeBron dunked or \"Laker's top scorer's tonight\" would find the stats of the top Laker's scorers, followed by seeking to exact moments of their plays in highlight videos." ;

    schema:description """The Financial Industry Business Ontology (FIBO) has matured in significant areas over the last few years, but until recently there were few examples to help users understand how to interpret it and build it into their own knowledge graphs. Since early 2019, the FIBO development team has been focused primarily on use cases to address the steep learning curve: \r
• How to represent businesses and incorporate data about them that is publicly available, such as identifiers, locations, ownership and control information and other details from the Global Legal Entity Identifier Foundation (GLEIF), Open Corporates, state and government registries, etc.,\r
• How to use that information to investigate counterparty relationships,\r
• How to build on that baseline to represent securities (stocks, bonds, etc.) issued by these organizations,\r
• How to leverage those securities to represent the components of an index and track index performance, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average,\r
• How to use this information to represent more complex derivative instruments.\r
In this talk, we will take a quick cook’s tour through some of the more basic use cases and related ontologies. The approach that FIBO has taken to build a use case stack that can be used to demonstrate the value of knowledge graphs translates well to most domain-specific projects. The use cases, ontologies, and reference and example data are all publicly available and open source. While some of the work is still underway, the basic building blocks are in place. Conference participants can download and try them, and the cook’s tour is intended to provide enough of an introduction to help make that feasible.""" ;

In addition, this solution is explainable; it can provide comprehensible recommendations which show the reason for each result along with a statistical measure. A detailed use case for this application which is an issue tracking system for Oil & Gas companies is presented in this work. In the introduced use case, the interlinks between failure events and their associated actions are captured in a knowledge graph. To overcome data sparsity, scarcity, and non-trivial relationships, a relatively new concept called ‘meta-graphs’ are employed. Using meta-graph patterns defined on the knowledge graph schema, we can recommend actions based on the semantic relatedness of the various failure events and their corrective actions. Moreover, the recommendation results selected by the end-user and the meta-graphs evaluated by the domain experts are automatically graded during the entire lifecycle of the system for transfer learning, reliability evaluation and reproducibility." ;

In this webinar, CEO Andreas Blumauer will talk about the different semantic tools you can have under your belt to manage your unstructured data and reap the benefits of a comprehensive knowledge graph. Learn how intelligent content that is generated with help from semantic technologies can improve customer satisfaction, enable better business decision making, and grant extensive knowledge discovery. Through introductory material and live demos, we will introduce you to semantic search and recommendation tools to “matchmake” internal HR profiles and connect employees together based on their skills and interests. You will become familiar with question and answering machines that can be used to generate structured search results from organic text, and how entity extraction can enable you to derive meaningful concepts from text analysis.

    schema:description "It is common practice for data providers to include text descriptions for each column when publishing data sets in the form of data dictionaries. While these documents are useful in helping an end-user properly interpret the meaning of a column in a data set, existing data dictionaries typically are not machine-readable and do not follow a common specification standard. We introduce the Semantic Data Dictionary, a specification that formalizes the assignment of a semantic representation of data, enabling standardization and harmonization across diverse data sets. The rendition of data in this form helps promote improved discovery, interoperability, reuse, traceability, and reproducibility. We present the associated research and describe how the Semantic Data Dictionary can help address existing limitations in the related literature. We discuss our approach, present an example by annotating portions of the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, present modeling challenges, and describe the use of this approach in sponsored research, including our work on a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded exposure and health data portal and in the RPI-IBM collaborative Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics project. This work has been evaluated in comparison with traditional data dictionaries, mapping languages, and data integration tools." ;

    schema:description "The switch to decentralization in data management is finally happening as organizations struggle with a disconnect between data teams and domain knowledge. Once a new organizational structure around data domains is in place, the need for platforms for managing data products appears. In this talk, we argue that knowledge technologies are best placed to be the technical layer for data products. Ontologies provide the flexibility and expressiveness to represent the complexities of domains. Knowledge graphs provide graph representation, query languages, and standard access APIs that are perfectly suited for cross-organizational data access. Last but not least knowledge graphs, being all about data integration, provide an efficient way to connect data inside and across domains through entity linking and shared vocabularies.

Yet, traditional processes for data management inevitably lead to a database that contains missing, outdated, invalid, or inconsistent data. Automated knowledge graph construction techniques are a scalable way to maintain and enforce the quality of data in real-world business databases and knowledge graphs offer an ideal representation for modeling the complex relationships between business entities and for validating properties and constraints.

Such annotations are a native feature in other contemporary graph data models (e.g., edge properties in the Property Graph model). In recent years, the RDF* approach has emerged to address this limitation of RDF. After RDF* gained traction among both vendors and users of RDF systems, a community group has formed to produce a specification of the approach, now called RDF-star. In February 2021, the group published a first working draft of this spec, which is accompanied by several test suites. This presentation will introduce the approach and the various features that it adds to RDF and SPARQL." ;

However, almost none of these have integration paths other than writing lots of custom code, and most do not share common file formats. Moreover, few of these libraries integrate effectively with popular data science tools (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch, spaCy, etc.) or with popular infrastructure for scale-out (Apache Spark, Ray, RAPIDS, Apache Parquet, fsspec, etc.) on cloud computing.

Relevant data are produced and publically shared at an unprecedented pace and updated daily. Given the urgency of the outbreak and the high levels of velocity and variety of pandemic-related data, efforts have not focused on data interoperability across domains. The avalanche of COVID-19-related data streams from agencies and public and private research teams, with little coordination and without reliance on best interoperability practices, creates enormous challenges for researchers attempting to analyze the pandemic in all its multi-disciplinary complexity and develop a comprehensive policy response. With data collection and analysis efforts largely fragmented and siloed, this goal can be addressed by the roll-out of a comprehensive semantic integration platform that organizes available information into an easily queryable transdisciplinary knowledge system. We developed the COVID-19-Net Knowledge Graph that integrates epidemiological, biological and population characteristic data.

One type of expert knowledge that has proven to be particularly useful in industry is reasoning by analogy, or using a replacement problem and solution pair to think about the solution to a new problem. At opposite ends of the ‘representation spectrum’ are logic systems, which can easily become overly constrained and complex, and statistical approaches, which can be easily influenced by nonsensical data. In this talk, I describe challenges and successes I’ve seen using analogical reasoning and how a knowledge graph approach combined with statistics and data can overcome deficiencies in both methods.

    schema:description "Semantic systems provide tremendous opportunities to interoperate our data, facilitate shared vocabularies, and power enterprise knowledge graphs, but these increasingly distributed data ecosystems also introduce new instabilities and concerns. What happens when data we rely on is changing in unexpected ways; how do we build trust around open-access data sources; what happens if a dataset suffers a catastrophic update that disrupts the entire data system it participates in? For data to participate in increasingly expansive and accessible semantic networks, it needs to be empowered with additional traceability, security, and trust. In this presentation, Trey will show how Fluree's platform works to do just that, by building its semantic graph database on top of an immutable ledger backplane that introduces a sense of truth and time to semantic data. This talk will look at how queries drastically improve when they become temporal; how a ledger backplane introduces time-traveling data; and how trust in data expands when data can reproduce its own lineage or prove the identity of the individual or machine who transacted it. The goal of the talk is to demonstrate that additional security and trust is not only a prerequisite for more expansive & interoperable data, but also a guarantee of richer, more powerful data that extends the reach of semantics into the fourth dimension." ;

Knowledge graphs have firmly established themselves as valuable sources of information for search and question answering, and it is natural to wonder if a KG can contain information about products offered at online retail sites. There have been several successful examples of generic KGs, but organizing information about products poses many additional challenges, including sparsity and noise of structured data for products, complexity of the domain with millions of product types and thousands of attributes, heterogeneity across a large number of categories, as well as large and constantly growing number of products. We present AutoKnow, our automatic (self-driving) system that addresses these challenges. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. AutoKnow is (a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, (b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions (many domains, many products, and many attributes), and (c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs.

For this reason, the addition of social determinants of health (SDoH) [1] and “observations of daily living” (ODL) [2] to the EHR have been proposed. This combination of medical, social, behavioral, and lifestyle information about the patient is essential for allowing medical events to be understood in the context of one’s life and, conversely, allowing lifestyle choices to be considered jointly with one’s medical context. We propose that the personal health knowledge graph is a semantic representation of a patient’s combined medical records, SDoH, and ODLs that would be generated by both patients and their providers and be potentially useful to both for decision-making. While there are some initial efforts to clarify what personal knowledge graphs are [3] and how they may be made specific to health [4, 5], there is still much to be determined concerning how to operationalize and apply such a knowledge graph in life and clinical practice. There are challenges in collecting, managing, integrating, and analyzing the data required to populate the knowledge graph, maintaining, reasoning over, and sharing aspects of the knowledge graph. Following on the success of our inaugural workshop held at the Knowledge Graph Conference in 2020, in the second installment of this workshop, we aim to gather multiple stakeholders (health practitioners, health informaticists, knowledge engineers, and computer scientists) working on defining, building, consuming, and integrating personal health knowledge graphs. The workshop will focus on the challenges and opportunities in this nascent space with a strong focus on existing PHKG solutions." ;

While many of these biochemicals have documented effects on health, they remain unquantified in any systematic fashion across different individual foods. Their invisibility to experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies defines them as the ‘Dark Matter of Nutrition.’ I will speak about our efforts to develop a high-resolution library of this nutritional dark matter, and the tole of network medicine and knowledge graphs in our journey to uncover the role of individual food molecules in our health, opening up novel avenues by which to understand, avoid, and control disease." ;

    schema:description "In the realm of data-driven businesses, structured data, being highly organized and easily understood by machines, is a valuable resource. IATE, with almost one million concepts storing multilingual terms and metadata, holds a large part of the textual knowledge of the EU. However, it can only be accessed lexically, and the database concepts stand-alone. If IATE were taxonomized, i.e. related concepts linked up into knowledge graphs yielding a full-fledged ontology, its data could not only be consumed by linguists but would also become accessible by the machine-readable SPARQL endpoint, which makes it a powerful resource for AI projects, particularly within SMEs that rarely have the means to create multilingual formalized knowledge. Coreon team elevated a sub-domain of IATE terminology into a multilingual knowledge graph. We taxonomized a flat list of 425 concepts within the COVID sub-domain, benchmarking two approaches to tackle this task: automatically through a custom-enhanced off-the-shelf language model and a manual creation of the knowledge graph by a linguist expert. The automatically created knowledge graph was later revised by a human, corrections and time effort measured and compared with performance metrics of the manual approach. In this talk, we will dwell on the performance and resource-saving advantages of our custom method and show how the achieved productivity rate can make the taxonomization of even large terminology databases economically viable. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our collaborative-robot approach in a typical industry use case scenario: using the resulting IATE/Covid graph for initialization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a multilingual document classification task, we get a classification granularity that is not reachable by state-of-the-art models, such as non-initialized CNNs and zero-shot classifiers." ;

    schema:description "It is a difficult task for traditional pattern-based matching or machine learning approaches to identify entities and the relationships they share. These techniques rapidly overfit training datasets and struggle to transfer to other contexts or domains. One solution to the lack of transferability includes the utilization of outside knowledge, such as facts contained in a knowledge base or ontology. However, integrating unstructured data such as language models with highly structured data such as knowledge bases is a challenging research problem. Using concepts from distant supervision, word vectors, and knowledge graph embeddings, an elegant unsupervised learning approach will be presented for solving this knowledge integration problem. This talk illustrates the problem from two points-of-view: the natural language processing practitioner unaccustomed to semantics and knowledge bases, and the semantic web developer without a background in deep learning and language models." ;

    schema:description "Personal Knowledge Graph generation is no longer a cumbersome technical endeavor. PROV4ITDaTa is an MIT open-source platform to provide a smooth user experience for generating knowledge graphs from your online web services, such as Google, Flickr, and Imgur, into your personal data space. This brings your personal data back under your control, and as a graph, its true interlinking potential is unleashed. PROV4ITDaTa allows to configure and set up a web application where users can easily pick one or more web services to extract their data from, transform that data into best-practice knowledge graphs, and push those graphs to a personal data space, such as a Solid pod. All heavy lifting is included in PROV4ITData: management of service authentication (e.g., OAuth 1.0/2.0 sessions), setting up the infrastructure to extract and transform your personal data from popular web services, directly loading those graphs into your personal data space, and generating a simple user interface. Developers only need to focus on providing custom connectors to more specialized web services and configuring the data processing pipeline to generate knowledge graphs into any needed form or shape. The data processing pipeline is based on RML.io, meaning that it is extensible to any data source, can integrate multiple data sources on the fly, includes data cleansing functions, supports any RDF graph structure and ontology, and its configuration is fully declarative. The pipelines are thus more maintainable and more transparent than hard-coded solutions such as the Data Transfer Project (DTP). Where existing platforms such as DTP provide one-to-one data transfer, PROV4ITDaTa enables extensible many-to-many data processing pipelines, beyond the web services and (personal) data spaces we currently provide. All these features can easily be included in the PROV4ITDaTa platform and will be showcased during the presentation. As a result, developers can more easily support custom web services. As users can generate personal knowledge graphs faster and easier, more knowledge graph applications can be built that rely on real-world data. With a click of a button, users can try out knowledge graph applications using their actual data from music streaming systems, fitness apps, address books, social media, etc. Continuing this product, we are building a data processing workbench, where these different data processing pipeline configurations can be managed, scheduled, and orchestrated, giving companies more control, and allowing to upscale PROV4ITData more easily." ;

    schema:description "Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), which was introduced as early as in 2006, has since gone on to establish a vital community and is currently one of the few semantic wiki solutions still in existence. SMW is an extension of MediaWiki, the software used for Wikipedia and many other projects, resulting in a largely sustainable codebase and ecosystem. There are many reasons why SMW should not be overlooked by the knowledge graph community: -SMW is capable of directly connecting to several triple stores (Blazegraph, Virtuoso, Jena), which is why it can be considered an interface for entering data into knowledge graphs. -	SMW can use its internal relational database (or ElasticSearch), enabling users to build simple knowledge graphs without in-depth knowledge about triple stores. -SMW has the built-in capability of exporting to RDF including building complete RDF data dumps that can be imported into existing knowledge graphs. -	SMW has the capability to reuse existing ontologies by importing vocabularies and providing unique identifiers. -The explicit semantic content of Semantic MediaWiki is formally interpreted in the OWL DL ontology language and is made available in XML/RDF format. -	A simple internal query language is available to query the internal knowledge graph from within SMW, without the requirement of having a SPARQL endpoint. However, extensions for implementing SPARQL in SMW are available as well. -SMW has the capability to enable data curation for experienced users responsible for the ontology as well as simple form-based input for regular users that can easily populate the KG with data. -There are several approaches to visualizing data in SMW, thus making the knowledge graph visible and interactive. -Implementing custom ontologies in SMW is quite easy, everything is built-in wiki pages (e.g. definition of properties and datatypes, forms and templates). -	SMW has low barriers to implementation as it is a clean extension to MediaWiki, which is PHP software running on regular web hosts. -In the talk, I will give an overview of the mentioned aspects and highlight some main differences to Wikibase – which is an alternative approach for managing structured data in MediaWiki – as well as the current limitations of SMW." ;

This hinders the process and necessitates significant resources. Having metadata-driven transformation is not new, however, adoption of standards (.e.g CDISC) has not shown yet its full added value. We propose to extend this metadata-driven approach beyond CDISC standards from the writing of the unstructured clinical study protocol to submission of the clinical study report to health authorities. By sharing and reusing metadata end-to-end of the drug development critical path, we shorten and automate key tasks hence improving the efficiency of the overall process." ;

By encoding information and knowledge about real-world entities and their relationships, the OKN would enable next generation artificial intelligence-based technologies and applications, focusing in particular on science and engineering information. While large-scale knowledge networks have been deployed in services like Google Search, Amazon catalogs, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and WolframAlpha, an open effort would expand this approach, enabling discovery of non-trivial information from multiple disparate knowledge sources for thousands of new topic areas in scientific and engineering information. With this objective in mind, the NSF Convergence Accelerator announced a “track” on the Open Knowledge Network (Track A) in 2019. Twenty-one projects were funded in Phase I in 2019 and five were funded in Phase II in 2020. Multidisciplinary, multi-sector teams in these projects are addressing a range of issues including, programming environments for knowledge network creation, making hidden/implied geospatial information explicit in knowledge graphs, and encoding information in specific domains, viz. urban flooding, biomedicine, and court records.

Graphs, as an abstraction, are a simple and intuitive way to model information about the world. Despite this, the learning curve for building a graph-based application remains steep and daunting, as it requires the use of tooling and processes that may seem unfamiliar, even to experienced data practitioners. Most importantly, there are components other than a graph database that are needed for a knowledge graph architecture. In this presentation we discuss these components, the tooling one needs to succeed in building a knowledge graph -driven application, and we present the idea of a “data value chain\": data flowing from legacy sources, through various manipulation steps, to a graph representation, ready to be consumed." ;

    schema:description "Knowledge Graphs (KGs) continue to penetrate the industrial world after Google's famous \"things not strings\" was used to explain their acquisition of FreeBase ten years ago. While many KGs exist, they are by and large little more than \"entity catalogs\", missing entirely the links between those entities. At Google, we recently launched a new enhancement to search that allows product queries, such as \"Milk\", \"Celery\" or \"12 string guitar\", to return local results - places on maps, nearby, that sell the product. The challenge to making this work is that 70% of stores worldwide - and 40% in the US - do not have a web page, Google's primary data source for search. To overcome this challenge and extend our understanding of small to medium-sized brick&mortar shops, we used a unique combination of Knowledge Graphs, AI and Human Common Sense, that demonstrates both the promises and limitations of AI in solving practical business problems." ;

    schema:description "Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) is a global pharmaceutical company with drug discovery and development programs in several therapeutic areas. As part of its enterprise information governance, there is an ongoing effort to unlock research data from siloed systems, by building a knowledge graph that transcends research domains and departments. The Hyve, a Dutch IT services provider for the biomedical domain, assists in this effort by creating semantic models of particular areas, such as computational genomics or clinical trials. In this case-study, we will share our experience modelling research data in Immuno-Oncology & Cell Therapy (IOCT). Here, traceability of research data through the development pipeline poses a particular problem because most data is currently stored in particular vendor solutions and departments. We will first introduce the semantic model that was created to model the IOCT research domain and data, and how it builds on public domain ontologies and existing BMS ontologies. We will then present our efforts to build a knowledge graph by instantiating this model using a selected set of research data. We will evaluate the strategies and tools we explored to unlock as much of the data as possible, and the end-to-end use cases that can now be answered using the knowledge graph." ;

    schema:description "Machine Learning (ML), as one of the key drivers of Artificial Intelligence, has demonstrated disruptive results in numerous industries. However, one of the most fundamental problems of applying ML, and particularly Artificial Neural Network models, in critical systems is its inability to provide a rationale for their decisions. For instance, a ML system recognizes an object to be a warfare mine through comparison with its similar observations. No human-transposable rationale is given, mainly because common sense knowledge or reasoning is out-of-scope of ML systems. We present how knowledge graphs could be applied to expose more human-understandable machine learning decisions, and present an asset, combining ML and knowledge graphs to expose a human-like explanation when recognizing an object of any class in a knowledge graph of 4,233,000 resources." ;

The PGSWG overlaps partially with the formal working group and consists of around 60 members from academia as well as industry. The academic members come from different research domains, including data storage, data management, query languages, query optimization, programming languages, data modeling and Semantic Web. The industrial partners come from companies such as TigerGraph, Neo4j, Amazon, FactGem, Google, Redis, Ant Group, Memgraph and Uber. The goal of PGSWG is to discuss the Property Graph data model and the schema language that will describe instances of this data model, both in the context of the SQL extension and outside of it. Discussions in the group cover topics such as the basic Property Graph data model, property types, subtyping, null values, key constraints and cardinality constraints.

This presentation will explore how the engineering of API ecosystems responds to governance and scope, before it responds to the analytical frameworks that triggered their development, as illustrated with hands-on visits to a number of live data sources.

    schema:description "The Wirecard scandal was one of the most shocking economic events in Germany in 2020. The former DAX30 company collapsed on June 25, owing creditors more than €3.5 billion (almost $4 billion) after disclosing a gaping hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud. But were there any signs that something went wrong? In our study, we gathered all relevant information from management and supervisory board members from the 30 largest companies (DAX30) in Germany for the fiscal year 2019. Relevant information includes place of birth, date of birth, education and work experience. Our knowledge graph contains 745 people, 1.203 companies and organizations, 5.116 roles and 1.128 degrees or educational programs. All this information helps us to understand what was different at Wirecard and what may be the reasons why Wirecard failed. Using a knowledge graph enables us to automatically detect and visualize all kinds of ties between supervisory and management board members, whereas detecting them manually requires more effort and is more error prone. The collection of the data reveals that there was little to no information available for most of the supervisory and management board members of Wirecard, which is uncommon for a DAX30 firm. In addition to that, it is obvious that the management board has far less work experience than managers from comparable companies. When looking at the experience of Wirecard’s supervisory board members, it becomes clear they were little or not all familiar with board activities. Furthermore, our graph shows that supervisory board members from Wirecard are less connected to other members of supervisory boards compared to other DAX30 companies." ;

    schema:description "How do falsehoods spread on the web? This and other questions related to the propagation of fake news and biased discourse in the public area have been drawing increasing interest in different communities from social sciences to artificial intelligence. Online discourse, i.e. claims and opinions shared online, together with their associated contexts (authors, salient entities, related events) constitute a valuable source of insights to these questions. While knowledge graphs of today enable data reuse and federation, improving information retrieval on the web and facilitating knowledge discovery in various fields, they do not store information about claims and related online discourse data, making it difficult to access, query and reuse this wealth of information. Hence, we have built ClaimsKG — a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims and their related metadata, such as the claims’ truth labels, authors, topics, keywords and references. The knowledge graph is built by extracting information from a number of popular fact-checking web portals and structuring it following a specifically developed for this purpose conceptual data model mainly based on schema.org and the NIF vocabularies. Among other applications, ClaimsKG provides ground truth data for a number of tasks relevant to the analysis of societal debates on the web. In this talk, I will first present three tools that operate on the data of ClaimsKG: (1) the Claims Explorer, which allows us to navigate through our data and perform a faceted search; (2) the Claims Statistical Observatory, which helps uncover trends; and (3) the ClaimLinker, which allows linking arbitrary text to claims from ClaimsKG (or any other Knowledge graph containing claims), hence assisting the task of fact verification. I will further discuss perspectives on modeling claims in a generalized and contextualized manner, as well as related challenges such as claim disambiguation and the assessment of claim relatedness." ;

Second, object-oriented codebases are proliferating complexity, trapping business logic, and stifling code reuse. Third, some experts warn we are heading for a software apocalypse. And finally we’re over paying for software projects by orders of magnitude. Where do we begin to resolve these problems? In this talk, we present a data-centric transformation.

In this talk, we will present the research and development on Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph, a platform built to deliver advanced clinical decision support and enhanced point-of-care content discovery for clinicians and patients. Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph uses popular linked data and semantic web technologies to capture knowledge and data from heterogeneous healthcare sources about diseases, drugs, findings, guidelines, cohorts, journals, and books. The graph is composed of medical concepts (e.g., drugs, symptoms), medical term labels and synonyms for these concepts, hierarchical and associative typed relations (e.g. drug-disease relations) between these concepts, and mappings to codes in external terminologies used in clinical data integration and electronic medical record systems. We will demonstrate how subject matter experts curate and visualize the Healthcare Knowledge Graph through novel exploration interfaces to keep the medical knowledge regularly updated, and also showcase how operationalized natural language processing pipelines continuously tag and extract novel medical concepts and relations within synoptic and reference medical content. We will walk through how Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph platform is used to provide actionable knowledge in user-facing applications in the domains of focused and precise clinical search, clinical decision support, and content recommendation. This talk will provide a perspective on how such knowledge graphs will enable the capture, representation, and provision of complex medical knowledge of high velocity, variety, volume, and veracity, to power, trusted clinical and biomedical research applications." ;

    schema:description "Social Knowledge Graphs such as Wikidata have become massive successes, obtaining a level of coverage and quality that would be the envy of many traditional relational database engineering projects. And yet the downstream use scenarios for such datasets remain sharply limited compared to the vast range of relational database applications. In this talk, Mike will present some early work that aims to make Knowledge Graph-powered applications easier to build. This work is the result of a large NSF-funded collaboration among researchers at the University of Michigan, MIT, UC Berkeley, the University of Washington, and the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence." ;

    schema:description "The enterprise data landscape is increasingly hybrid, varied, and changing. The emergence of IoT, rise in unstructured data volume, increasing relevance of external data sources, and trend towards hybrid multi-cloud environments are obstacles to satisfying each new data request. The old data strategy centered around relational data systems is fundamentally broken. Enterprise data fabrics offer a new way forward. The data fabric weaves together data from internal silos and external sources and creates a network of information to power your applications, AI, and analytics. Quite simply, they support the full breadth of today’s complex, connected enterprise. -	But how to achieve a data fabric? In this session, you’ll learn: -Key steps for building a data fabric and how to leverage existing data management investments -The technical skills and resources required to begin your data fabric implementation-An MVP methodology for data modeling to drive compounding business value" ;

    schema:description "The Yahoo Knowledge Graph powers entity data for user experiences across multiple products at Verizon Media, from search to media to ads. Nodes in the knowledge graph correspond to real world entities: people, places, movies, sports teams, and so on. The edges represent semantic relationships between these entities. A comprehensive entity experience requires collecting a use-case specific subgraph around an entity node in the graph and combining it with dynamic and multimedia content. A \"knowledge panel\" for a public company on a web search results page might include basic data like the company's founders and number of employees, combined with a realtime stock quote and relevant images. Other use cases, like a finance-focused website, may prefer to include additional detailed information like the board members, other companies those board members represent, revenue numbers, top competitors, and more. Legacy serving systems typically pre-collected and exposed a static view of an entity, which limited the ability for clients to traverse the graph or adapt the user experience for different contexts without offline preprocessing. They also required clients to implement a more complex series of requests to fetch partial data, extract dependencies, and query additional services to stitch together their full experience. In this talk we will take you through our experience moving away from serving these static subgraph views with independent services and client side processing. We will describe how we addressed the shortcomings of such a system and built a federated, realtime, web-scale graph querying framework with GraphQL on top of Amazon Neptune, Vespa, and third party APIs. Our unified graph approach has enabled customer teams to experiment, rapidly iterate over their designs, and easily power rich experiences by bringing together all the relevant data under a single request." ;
