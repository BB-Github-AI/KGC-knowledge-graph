kgcr:000767 schema:abstract "Our understanding of how diet affects our health is limited to the role of 150 key nutritional components systematically tracked by the USDA and other national databases in all foods. Yet, these nutritional components represent only a tiny fraction of the over 26,000 distinct, definable biochemicals present in our food. While many of these biochemicals have documented effects on health, they remain unquantified in any systematic fashion across different individual foods. Their invisibility to experimental, clinical, and epidemiological studies defines them as the ‘Dark Matter of Nutrition.’ I will speak about our efforts to develop a high-resolution library of this nutritional dark matter, and the tole of network medicine and knowledge graphs in our journey to uncover the role of individual food molecules in our health, opening up novel avenues by which to understand, avoid, and control disease." ;

kgcr:000770 schema:abstract "In the realm of data-driven businesses, structured data, being highly organized and easily understood by machines, is a valuable resource. IATE, with almost one million concepts storing multilingual terms and metadata, holds a large part of the textual knowledge of the EU. However, it can only be accessed lexically, and the database concepts stand-alone. If IATE were taxonomized, i.e. related concepts linked up into knowledge graphs yielding a full-fledged ontology, its data could not only be consumed by linguists but would also become accessible by the machine-readable SPARQL endpoint, which makes it a powerful resource for AI projects, particularly within SMEs that rarely have the means to create multilingual formalized knowledge. Coreon team elevated a sub-domain of IATE terminology into a multilingual knowledge graph. We taxonomized a flat list of 425 concepts within the COVID sub-domain, benchmarking two approaches to tackle this task: automatically through a custom-enhanced off-the-shelf language model and a manual creation of the knowledge graph by a linguist expert. The automatically created knowledge graph was later revised by a human, corrections and time effort measured and compared with performance metrics of the manual approach. In this talk, we will dwell on the performance and resource-saving advantages of our custom method and show how the achieved productivity rate can make the taxonomization of even large terminology databases economically viable. We demonstrate empirically the effectiveness of our collaborative-robot approach in a typical industry use case scenario: using the resulting IATE/Covid graph for initialization of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in a multilingual document classification task, we get a classification granularity that is not reachable by state-of-the-art models, such as non-initialized CNNs and zero-shot classifiers." ;

    schema:abstract "It is a difficult task for traditional pattern-based matching or machine learning approaches to identify entities and the relationships they share. These techniques rapidly overfit training datasets and struggle to transfer to other contexts or domains. One solution to the lack of transferability includes the utilization of outside knowledge, such as facts contained in a knowledge base or ontology. However, integrating unstructured data such as language models with highly structured data such as knowledge bases is a challenging research problem. Using concepts from distant supervision, word vectors, and knowledge graph embeddings, an elegant unsupervised learning approach will be presented for solving this knowledge integration problem. This talk illustrates the problem from two points-of-view: the natural language processing practitioner unaccustomed to semantics and knowledge bases, and the semantic web developer without a background in deep learning and language models." ;

    schema:abstract "Electronic health records (EHRs) have become a popular source of observational health data for learning insights that could inform the treatment of acute medical conditions. However, their utility for learning insights for informing preventive care and management of chronic conditions has remained limited. For this reason, the addition of social determinants of health (SDoH) [1] and “observations of daily living” (ODL) [2] to the EHR have been proposed. This combination of medical, social, behavioral, and lifestyle information about the patient is essential for allowing medical events to be understood in the context of one’s life and, conversely, allowing lifestyle choices to be considered jointly with one’s medical context. We propose that the personal health knowledge graph is a semantic representation of a patient’s combined medical records, SDoH, and ODLs that would be generated by both patients and their providers and be potentially useful to both for decision-making. While there are some initial efforts to clarify what personal knowledge graphs are [3] and how they may be made specific to health [4, 5], there is still much to be determined concerning how to operationalize and apply such a knowledge graph in life and clinical practice. There are challenges in collecting, managing, integrating, and analyzing the data required to populate the knowledge graph, maintaining, reasoning over, and sharing aspects of the knowledge graph. Following on the success of our inaugural workshop held at the Knowledge Graph Conference in 2020, in the second installment of this workshop, we aim to gather multiple stakeholders (health practitioners, health informaticists, knowledge engineers, and computer scientists) working on defining, building, consuming, and integrating personal health knowledge graphs. The workshop will focus on the challenges and opportunities in this nascent space with a strong focus on existing PHKG solutions.",

        "Over a third of analyst time is spent in understanding what data exists, can it be trusted and how to use it. Countless Data Engineering time is spent in answering the same questions about data - what does that column mean, how does it get populated, how often does it update and if there’s any incident going on? The answer thus far to such questions has been curation. You request volunteers to put in this information or hire project managers to make sure it does but it always fails because documentation gets out of date. The holy grail to solving this is automation - collecting metadata automatically from various data sources and creating a rich graph - of data sets, reports, humans, jobs, streams, event schemas and more. Then build opinionated products on top of it to deliver a better experience for data users. At Lyft, we have made our analysts and data scientists over 20% more productive by making it easier to discover data. Recently, we open sourced Amundsen and it’s now being used by ING, Square, Workday and many more. However, as we made it easy to discover data, it’s led to an interesting challenge. Not only is it now easy to discover good trusted data, it’s also easier to discover bad data that was previously hidden in the unforgotten nook and crannies of the data lake. Consequently, we are now asking ourselves, how can we recommend not just any data but trusted data to our users. This talk gives a quick overview of Amundsen and then goes into detail on how we have tried both automated and curated metadata to showcase what’s trusted and not in Amundsen. It will dive deep into linking the Airflow DAG which produced the data (task level lineage), linking what and how many dashboards are built from a given data set (table level lineage), as well as SLAs and historical landing times to give users signal into what’s trusted. The talk will end with an insight into current challenges and how we may solve them in the future." ;

Most focus of Knowledge Graphs has been on its construction, however, harnessing knowledge graphs/symbolic knowledge for end tasks is yet to be well explored. Particularly, integrating information from knowledge graphs with learning techniques for solving tasks. We call this “knowledge-infused learning” (KiL), an approach to encode knowledge for using it with deep learning. Knowledge Graphs are important in its use for neuro-symbolic AI [3,5,8].

When an organization produces data that is hard to manage, what methodologies can be used to turn unstructured (i.e., noisy, cluttered, unclear) content into clean, fruitful knowledge? In this webinar, CEO Andreas Blumauer will talk about the different semantic tools you can have under your belt to manage your unstructured data and reap the benefits of a comprehensive knowledge graph. Learn how intelligent content that is generated with help from semantic technologies can improve customer satisfaction, enable better business decision making, and grant extensive knowledge discovery. Through introductory material and live demos, we will introduce you to semantic search and recommendation tools to “matchmake” internal HR profiles and connect employees together based on their skills and interests. You will become familiar with question and answering machines that can be used to generate structured search results from organic text, and how entity extraction can enable you to derive meaningful concepts from text analysis. Don’t miss this opportunity to hear from an experienced semantic technology expert about how you can overcome the common roadblocks found in your unstructured data." ;

    schema:abstract "Personal Knowledge Graph generation is no longer a cumbersome technical endeavor. PROV4ITDaTa is an MIT open-source platform to provide a smooth user experience for generating knowledge graphs from your online web services, such as Google, Flickr, and Imgur, into your personal data space. This brings your personal data back under your control, and as a graph, its true interlinking potential is unleashed. PROV4ITDaTa allows to configure and set up a web application where users can easily pick one or more web services to extract their data from, transform that data into best-practice knowledge graphs, and push those graphs to a personal data space, such as a Solid pod. All heavy lifting is included in PROV4ITData: management of service authentication (e.g., OAuth 1.0/2.0 sessions), setting up the infrastructure to extract and transform your personal data from popular web services, directly loading those graphs into your personal data space, and generating a simple user interface. Developers only need to focus on providing custom connectors to more specialized web services and configuring the data processing pipeline to generate knowledge graphs into any needed form or shape. The data processing pipeline is based on RML.io, meaning that it is extensible to any data source, can integrate multiple data sources on the fly, includes data cleansing functions, supports any RDF graph structure and ontology, and its configuration is fully declarative. The pipelines are thus more maintainable and more transparent than hard-coded solutions such as the Data Transfer Project (DTP). Where existing platforms such as DTP provide one-to-one data transfer, PROV4ITDaTa enables extensible many-to-many data processing pipelines, beyond the web services and (personal) data spaces we currently provide. All these features can easily be included in the PROV4ITDaTa platform and will be showcased during the presentation. As a result, developers can more easily support custom web services. As users can generate personal knowledge graphs faster and easier, more knowledge graph applications can be built that rely on real-world data. With a click of a button, users can try out knowledge graph applications using their actual data from music streaming systems, fitness apps, address books, social media, etc. Continuing this product, we are building a data processing workbench, where these different data processing pipeline configurations can be managed, scheduled, and orchestrated, giving companies more control, and allowing to upscale PROV4ITData more easily." ;

    schema:abstract "Semantic MediaWiki (SMW), which was introduced as early as in 2006, has since gone on to establish a vital community and is currently one of the few semantic wiki solutions still in existence. SMW is an extension of MediaWiki, the software used for Wikipedia and many other projects, resulting in a largely sustainable codebase and ecosystem. There are many reasons why SMW should not be overlooked by the knowledge graph community: -SMW is capable of directly connecting to several triple stores (Blazegraph, Virtuoso, Jena), which is why it can be considered an interface for entering data into knowledge graphs. -	SMW can use its internal relational database (or ElasticSearch), enabling users to build simple knowledge graphs without in-depth knowledge about triple stores. -SMW has the built-in capability of exporting to RDF including building complete RDF data dumps that can be imported into existing knowledge graphs. -	SMW has the capability to reuse existing ontologies by importing vocabularies and providing unique identifiers. -The explicit semantic content of Semantic MediaWiki is formally interpreted in the OWL DL ontology language and is made available in XML/RDF format. -	A simple internal query language is available to query the internal knowledge graph from within SMW, without the requirement of having a SPARQL endpoint. However, extensions for implementing SPARQL in SMW are available as well. -SMW has the capability to enable data curation for experienced users responsible for the ontology as well as simple form-based input for regular users that can easily populate the KG with data. -There are several approaches to visualizing data in SMW, thus making the knowledge graph visible and interactive. -Implementing custom ontologies in SMW is quite easy, everything is built-in wiki pages (e.g. definition of properties and datatypes, forms and templates). -	SMW has low barriers to implementation as it is a clean extension to MediaWiki, which is PHP software running on regular web hosts. -In the talk, I will give an overview of the mentioned aspects and highlight some main differences to Wikibase – which is an alternative approach for managing structured data in MediaWiki – as well as the current limitations of SMW." ;

The decade unfolding now is a critical period for transforming our “business as usual” routines into new practices that reduce global carbon emissions below thresholds sufficient to avert irreversible planetary damage. This workshop, hosted by Common Action – a community collaboration platform for climate action – explores how to model pathways for action. In other words, let's demonstrate how knowledge graphs are being used to spotlight where individuals and groups can contribute directly. For this initial workshop we will prioritize modeling a “backbone” of the knowledge graph for Common Action. This component is intended to track key people and their projects, and also link to related KG projects which provide complementary graph data.
In the first session of this workshop, a series of SMEs and data modelers will share 5-10 minute lightning presentations, providing glimpses into sectors across climate action. The goal of these presentations will be to share a high-level overview of the concepts and problems in the space, in order to make apparent synergies for collective modeling, and ultimately, collaborative action.

This hinders the process and necessitates significant resources. Having metadata-driven transformation is not new, however, adoption of standards (.e.g CDISC) has not shown yet its full added value. We propose to extend this metadata-driven approach beyond CDISC standards from the writing of the unstructured clinical study protocol to submission of the clinical study report to health authorities. By sharing and reusing metadata end-to-end of the drug development critical path, we shorten and automate key tasks hence improving the efficiency of the overall process." ;

While large-scale knowledge networks have been deployed in services like Google Search, Amazon catalogs, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana, and WolframAlpha, an open effort would expand this approach, enabling discovery of non-trivial information from multiple disparate knowledge sources for thousands of new topic areas in scientific and engineering information. With this objective in mind, the NSF Convergence Accelerator announced a “track” on the Open Knowledge Network (Track A) in 2019. Twenty-one projects were funded in Phase I in 2019 and five were funded in Phase II in 2020. Multidisciplinary, multi-sector teams in these projects are addressing a range of issues including, programming environments for knowledge network creation, making hidden/implied geospatial information explicit in knowledge graphs, and encoding information in specific domains, viz. urban flooding, biomedicine, and court records.

While many KGs exist, they are by and large little more than \"entity catalogs\", missing entirely the links between those entities. At Google, we recently launched a new enhancement to search that allows product queries, such as \"Milk\", \"Celery\" or \"12 string guitar\", to return local results - places on maps, nearby, that sell the product. The challenge to making this work is that 70% of stores worldwide - and 40% in the US - do not have a web page, Google's primary data source for search.

In this case-study, we will share our experience modelling research data in Immuno-Oncology & Cell Therapy (IOCT). Here, traceability of research data through the development pipeline poses a particular problem because most data is currently stored in particular vendor solutions and departments. We will first introduce the semantic model that was created to model the IOCT research domain and data, and how it builds on public domain ontologies and existing BMS ontologies. We will then present our efforts to build a knowledge graph by instantiating this model using a selected set of research data.

kgcr:000898 schema:abstract "It is common practice for data providers to include text descriptions for each column when publishing data sets in the form of data dictionaries. While these documents are useful in helping an end-user properly interpret the meaning of a column in a data set, existing data dictionaries typically are not machine-readable and do not follow a common specification standard. We introduce the Semantic Data Dictionary, a specification that formalizes the assignment of a semantic representation of data, enabling standardization and harmonization across diverse data sets. The rendition of data in this form helps promote improved discovery, interoperability, reuse, traceability, and reproducibility. We present the associated research and describe how the Semantic Data Dictionary can help address existing limitations in the related literature. We discuss our approach, present an example by annotating portions of the publicly available National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey data set, present modeling challenges, and describe the use of this approach in sponsored research, including our work on a large National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded exposure and health data portal and in the RPI-IBM collaborative Health Empowerment by Analytics, Learning, and Semantics project. This work has been evaluated in comparison with traditional data dictionaries, mapping languages, and data integration tools." ;

        "The Property Graph Schema Working Group (PGSWG) is an informal working group that was set up in 2018 under the umbrella of LDBC, the Linked Data Benchmark Council, to support the formal working group that works on the SQL/PGQ and GQL, the upcoming ISO/IEC standards for managing property graphs. The PGSWG overlaps partially with the formal working group and consists of around 60 members from academia as well as industry. The academic members come from different research domains, including data storage, data management, query languages, query optimization, programming languages, data modeling and Semantic Web. The industrial partners come from companies such as TigerGraph, Neo4j, Amazon, FactGem, Google, Redis, Ant Group, Memgraph and Uber. The goal of PGSWG is to discuss the Property Graph data model and the schema language that will describe instances of this data model, both in the context of the SQL extension and outside of it. Discussions in the group cover topics such as the basic Property Graph data model, property types, subtyping, null values, key constraints and cardinality constraints. In this presentation we will give a brief overview of the history of this working group, the current status of its discussions and where they might be going in the near future." ;

This space has been forced to evolve significantly to meet the real-time requirements of COVID-19 information systems, to the extent that syntactic interoperability often takes precedence over aligning data structures with conceptual context. This presentation will explore how the engineering of API ecosystems responds to governance and scope, before it responds to the analytical frameworks that triggered their development, as illustrated with hands-on visits to a number of live data sources. It will be argued that both knowledge representation and statistical learning (AI) benefit from being an afterthought of this evolutionary process." ;

    schema:abstract "The Wirecard scandal was one of the most shocking economic events in Germany in 2020. The former DAX30 company collapsed on June 25, owing creditors more than €3.5 billion (almost $4 billion) after disclosing a gaping hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud. But were there any signs that something went wrong? In our study, we gathered all relevant information from management and supervisory board members from the 30 largest companies (DAX30) in Germany for the fiscal year 2019. Relevant information includes place of birth, date of birth, education and work experience. Our knowledge graph contains 745 people, 1.203 companies and organizations, 5.116 roles and 1.128 degrees or educational programs. All this information helps us to understand what was different at Wirecard and what may be the reasons why Wirecard failed. Using a knowledge graph enables us to automatically detect and visualize all kinds of ties between supervisory and management board members, whereas detecting them manually requires more effort and is more error prone. The collection of the data reveals that there was little to no information available for most of the supervisory and management board members of Wirecard, which is uncommon for a DAX30 firm. In addition to that, it is obvious that the management board has far less work experience than managers from comparable companies. When looking at the experience of Wirecard’s supervisory board members, it becomes clear they were little or not all familiar with board activities. Furthermore, our graph shows that supervisory board members from Wirecard are less connected to other members of supervisory boards compared to other DAX30 companies." ;

Once a new organizational structure around data domains is in place, the need for platforms for managing data products appears. In this talk, we argue that knowledge technologies are best placed to be the technical layer for data products. Ontologies provide the flexibility and expressiveness to represent the complexities of domains. Knowledge graphs provide graph representation, query languages, and standard access APIs that are perfectly suited for cross-organizational data access. Last but not least knowledge graphs, being all about data integration, provide an efficient way to connect data inside and across domains through entity linking and shared vocabularies.

    schema:abstract "How do falsehoods spread on the web? This and other questions related to the propagation of fake news and biased discourse in the public area have been drawing increasing interest in different communities from social sciences to artificial intelligence. Online discourse, i.e. claims and opinions shared online, together with their associated contexts (authors, salient entities, related events) constitute a valuable source of insights to these questions. While knowledge graphs of today enable data reuse and federation, improving information retrieval on the web and facilitating knowledge discovery in various fields, they do not store information about claims and related online discourse data, making it difficult to access, query and reuse this wealth of information. Hence, we have built ClaimsKG — a knowledge graph of fact-checked claims and their related metadata, such as the claims’ truth labels, authors, topics, keywords and references. The knowledge graph is built by extracting information from a number of popular fact-checking web portals and structuring it following a specifically developed for this purpose conceptual data model mainly based on schema.org and the NIF vocabularies. Among other applications, ClaimsKG provides ground truth data for a number of tasks relevant to the analysis of societal debates on the web. In this talk, I will first present three tools that operate on the data of ClaimsKG: (1) the Claims Explorer, which allows us to navigate through our data and perform a faceted search; (2) the Claims Statistical Observatory, which helps uncover trends; and (3) the ClaimLinker, which allows linking arbitrary text to claims from ClaimsKG (or any other Knowledge graph containing claims), hence assisting the task of fact verification. I will further discuss perspectives on modeling claims in a generalized and contextualized manner, as well as related challenges such as claim disambiguation and the assessment of claim relatedness." ;

In this talk, we will present the research and development on Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph, a platform built to deliver advanced clinical decision support and enhanced point-of-care content discovery for clinicians and patients. Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph uses popular linked data and semantic web technologies to capture knowledge and data from heterogeneous healthcare sources about diseases, drugs, findings, guidelines, cohorts, journals, and books. The graph is composed of medical concepts (e.g., drugs, symptoms), medical term labels and synonyms for these concepts, hierarchical and associative typed relations (e.g. drug-disease relations) between these concepts, and mappings to codes in external terminologies used in clinical data integration and electronic medical record systems. We will demonstrate how subject matter experts curate and visualize the Healthcare Knowledge Graph through novel exploration interfaces to keep the medical knowledge regularly updated, and also showcase how operationalized natural language processing pipelines continuously tag and extract novel medical concepts and relations within synoptic and reference medical content. We will walk through how Elsevier’s Healthcare Knowledge Graph platform is used to provide actionable knowledge in user-facing applications in the domains of focused and precise clinical search, clinical decision support, and content recommendation. This talk will provide a perspective on how such knowledge graphs will enable the capture, representation, and provision of complex medical knowledge of high velocity, variety, volume, and veracity, to power, trusted clinical and biomedical research applications." ;

    schema:abstract "The Yahoo Knowledge Graph powers entity data for user experiences across multiple products at Verizon Media, from search to media to ads. Nodes in the knowledge graph correspond to real world entities: people, places, movies, sports teams, and so on. The edges represent semantic relationships between these entities. A comprehensive entity experience requires collecting a use-case specific subgraph around an entity node in the graph and combining it with dynamic and multimedia content. A \"knowledge panel\" for a public company on a web search results page might include basic data like the company's founders and number of employees, combined with a realtime stock quote and relevant images. Other use cases, like a finance-focused website, may prefer to include additional detailed information like the board members, other companies those board members represent, revenue numbers, top competitors, and more. Legacy serving systems typically pre-collected and exposed a static view of an entity, which limited the ability for clients to traverse the graph or adapt the user experience for different contexts without offline preprocessing. They also required clients to implement a more complex series of requests to fetch partial data, extract dependencies, and query additional services to stitch together their full experience. In this talk we will take you through our experience moving away from serving these static subgraph views with independent services and client side processing. We will describe how we addressed the shortcomings of such a system and built a federated, realtime, web-scale graph querying framework with GraphQL on top of Amazon Neptune, Vespa, and third party APIs. Our unified graph approach has enabled customer teams to experiment, rapidly iterate over their designs, and easily power rich experiences by bringing together all the relevant data under a single request." ;

Such annotations are a native feature in other contemporary graph data models (e.g., edge properties in the Property Graph model). In recent years, the RDF* approach has emerged to address this limitation of RDF. After RDF* gained traction among both vendors and users of RDF systems, a community group has formed to produce a specification of the approach, now called RDF-star. In February 2021, the group published a first working draft of this spec, which is accompanied by several test suites. This presentation will introduce the approach and the various features that it adds to RDF and SPARQL." ;

    schema:abstract "The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized researchers worldwide to investigate many aspects of the outbreak, ranging from case statistics, patient demographics, transportation modeling, epidemiological studies, to viral genome sequencing. Relevant data are produced and publically shared at an unprecedented pace and updated daily. Given the urgency of the outbreak and the high levels of velocity and variety of pandemic-related data, efforts have not focused on data interoperability across domains. The avalanche of COVID-19-related data streams from agencies and public and private research teams, with little coordination and without reliance on best interoperability practices, creates enormous challenges for researchers attempting to analyze the pandemic in all its multi-disciplinary complexity and develop a comprehensive policy response. With data collection and analysis efforts largely fragmented and siloed, this goal can be addressed by the roll-out of a comprehensive semantic integration platform that organizes available information into an easily queryable transdisciplinary knowledge system. We developed the COVID-19-Net Knowledge Graph that integrates epidemiological, biological and population characteristic data. The challenges of integrating data across diverse domains, proposed solutions, and calls for action to prepare for future outbreaks will be discussed." ;

    schema:abstract "The Bloomberg Knowledge Graph is a graph-centric representation of entities and relationships in the financial world which connects cross-domain data from various sources within Bloomberg. Recent developments in machine learning, knowledge graphs, and language technology have enabled intelligent ways to uncover interesting patterns amongst data that reveal previously hidden insights. By leveraging the entity and relationship information in the knowledge graph, interesting potential applications emerge, especially when combined with other information such as market data and news stories. This talk details how Bloomberg uses the knowledge graph and semantic technologies to enable various use cases, e.g., to link data across different domains, enrich news stories, and support financial analytics centered around entities. In addition, we will discuss the challenges we face to support these use cases, including representing and storing historical, point-in-time relationships between entities." ;

    schema:abstract " In this talk we describe a new technique for merging knowledge graphs: translating the knowledge graph schemas into categories and the knowledge graph data into functors, then applying the \"co-limit/pushout\" construction from a branch of mathematics called category theory to merge these categories and functors, and then converting the categories and functors back into knowledge graph schemas and data. We show how this process is mathematically optimal (results in the highest possible data quality in the merge), and describe several real-world use cases of knowledge graph merge that have been implemented in an open-source tool.

    schema:abstract "Knowledge graphs provide a way for us to capture and relate information into a representation that can mimic expert knowledge. One type of expert knowledge that has proven to be particularly useful in industry is reasoning by analogy, or using a replacement problem and solution pair to think about the solution to a new problem. At opposite ends of the ‘representation spectrum’ are logic systems, which can easily become overly constrained and complex, and statistical approaches, which can be easily influenced by nonsensical data. In this talk, I describe challenges and successes I’ve seen using analogical reasoning and how a knowledge graph approach combined with statistics and data can overcome deficiencies in both methods. To illustrate the case, I’ll demonstrate how our financial decision support application leverages analogical reasoning in several places to answer challenging questions when evaluating organizations." ;

    schema:abstract "Semantic systems provide tremendous opportunities to interoperate our data, facilitate shared vocabularies, and power enterprise knowledge graphs, but these increasingly distributed data ecosystems also introduce new instabilities and concerns. What happens when data we rely on is changing in unexpected ways; how do we build trust around open-access data sources; what happens if a dataset suffers a catastrophic update that disrupts the entire data system it participates in? For data to participate in increasingly expansive and accessible semantic networks, it needs to be empowered with additional traceability, security, and trust. In this presentation, Trey will show how Fluree's platform works to do just that, by building its semantic graph database on top of an immutable ledger backplane that introduces a sense of truth and time to semantic data. This talk will look at how queries drastically improve when they become temporal; how a ledger backplane introduces time-traveling data; and how trust in data expands when data can reproduce its own lineage or prove the identity of the individual or machine who transacted it. The goal of the talk is to demonstrate that additional security and trust is not only a prerequisite for more expansive & interoperable data, but also a guarantee of richer, more powerful data that extends the reach of semantics into the fourth dimension." ;

    schema:abstract "When transforming amounts of plain text into semantic knowledge graphs using Resource Description Framework, a service for automatic interpretation became apparent. Manual interpretation of text depends on human domain knowledge and discovery of entities and relationships in the text. This process is a highly time-consuming activity with a risk of misinterpretation. Based on the hypothesis that using Natural Language Processing techniques we can extract information and meaning from text faster than a human being, we successfully implemented a service for automatic metadata and ontology generation for a client in Norwegian public sector. This presentation will walk you through our hypothesis, the steps from text to RDF through Natural Language Processing, and our results." ;

kgcr:001019 schema:abstract "Knowledge graphs have emerged as a compelling abstraction for organizing the world’s knowledge over the internet, capturing relationships among key entities of interest to enterprises, and a way to integrate information extracted from multiple data sources. Construction and maintenance of large-scale knowledge graphs requires leveraging knowledge representation, machine learning, and natural language processing. In addition, for applications that use machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision, knowledge graphs are being increasingly used as a knowledge representation for capturing and tracking the learned knowledge. Most major AI/NLP/Vision conferences attract a significant number of research papers that leverage knowledge graphs. While several knowledge graphs have been built and deployed in the industry today, their creation and successful maintenance requires addressing numerous challenges." ;

    schema:abstract "Can one build a knowledge graph (KG) for all products in the world? Knowledge graphs have firmly established themselves as valuable sources of information for search and question answering, and it is natural to wonder if a KG can contain information about products offered at online retail sites. There have been several successful examples of generic KGs, but organizing information about products poses many additional challenges, including sparsity and noise of structured data for products, complexity of the domain with millions of product types and thousands of attributes, heterogeneity across a large number of categories, as well as large and constantly growing number of products. We present AutoKnow, our automatic (self-driving) system that addresses these challenges. The system includes a suite of novel techniques for taxonomy construction, product property identification, knowledge extraction, anomaly detection, and synonym discovery. AutoKnow is (a) automatic, requiring little human intervention, (b) multi-scalable, scalable in multiple dimensions (many domains, many products, and many attributes), and (c) integrative, exploiting rich customer behavior logs. AutoKnow has been operational in collecting product knowledge for over 11K product types." ;

    schema:abstract "When knowledge graphs in your company get larger and larger, a scalable graph search is in high demand. In the current graph search solutions, scalability is still a big issue. Furthermore, with the fast development of deep learning on graphs, many companies rely on deep learning methods to mine insights from the ever-increasing knowledge graphs. But search and mining are usually not available in one package. This presentation will showcase the scalable solutions from Katana Graph which provide the end-to-end solutions for graph search and mining. It is ten times faster than the current market solutions and scales exponentially on graphs with billions or even trillions of nodes. It provides weighted k-shorted path searches and cutting edge graph deep learning methods (such as cluster-graph convolutional neural network, graph attention model, and graph transformer). Katana Graph is a start-up company founded by several faculty from University of Texas at Austin with the goal to provide the scalable graph search and deep graph mining in one click. In this presentation, we will showcase several use cases, such as searching and mining large scale knowledge graphs in drug discovery" ;

    schema:abstract "Electronic health records (EHRs) have become a popular source of observational health data for learning insights that could inform the treatment of acute medical conditions. However, their utility for learning insights for informing preventive care and management of chronic conditions has remained limited. For this reason, the addition of social determinants of health (SDoH) [1] and “observations of daily living” (ODL) [2] to the EHR have been proposed. This combination of medical, social, behavioral, and lifestyle information about the patient is essential for allowing medical events to be understood in the context of one’s life and, conversely, allowing lifestyle choices to be considered jointly with one’s medical context. We propose that the personal health knowledge graph is a semantic representation of a patient’s combined medical records, SDoH, and ODLs that would be generated by both patients and their providers and be potentially useful to both for decision-making. While there are some initial efforts to clarify what personal knowledge graphs are [3] and how they may be made specific to health [4, 5], there is still much to be determined concerning how to operationalize and apply such a knowledge graph in life and clinical practice. There are challenges in collecting, managing, integrating, and analyzing the data required to populate the knowledge graph, maintaining, reasoning over, and sharing aspects of the knowledge graph. Following on the success of our inaugural workshop held at the Knowledge Graph Conference in 2020, in the second installment of this workshop, we aim to gather multiple stakeholders (health practitioners, health informaticists, knowledge engineers, and computer scientists) working on defining, building, consuming, and integrating personal health knowledge graphs. The workshop will focus on the challenges and opportunities in this nascent space with a strong focus on existing PHKG solutions." ;
