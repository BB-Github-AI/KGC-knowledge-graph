# The KGC Community Knowledge Graphs

This repository contains a number of knowledge graphs built by the community. 

Current projects:
* The conference graphs contains information about the Knowledge Graph Conference: speakers, talks, organizations, topics. We will keep updating it with each new instance of the conference.
* The event calendar. As we organize side events such as the Knowledge Graph Meetup, Knowledge Connexions, Knowledge Espresso, the book clubs, Office Hours, etc, we structure events data as a knowledge graph and are currently working to publish that information as our event web page. 
* KG tools. An ongoing effort to build a knowledge graph of tools to build and manage KGs.
* The Book Club Ontology project is a community effort started by members of the KGC book club to represent book club information as a knowledge graph.

As we progress in these projects we will try to build proper governance for identifiers and vocabularies so that these knowledge graphs nicely integrate together.

For more information on these projects join the discussion on our [Community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/knowledgeconnexions/shared_invite/zt-fwx8vfx0-98zo7w138tiMt8y7PwYs6A)
